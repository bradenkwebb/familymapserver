# familymapserver

This repository contains the code (all Java) needed to run the server for the FamilyMap project that 
I completed as part of CS 240 during the summer of 2022. The overarching project was to build an Android app in which users could
store, modify, visualize their genealogical information, including their ancestors' names, birthdays,
life events, relationships, and the geographic places where they lived and traveled. This involved building
a server to implement the back-end database management aspect for multiple users, as well as the front-end
Android application for viewers to login, input information, and interface with that information in formats
that include a map GUI through the Google Maps API.

In general, the class objectives included the following:

- Have experience in and be comfortable with programming large programs
- Be able to apply problem-solving techniques to large programs
- Be familiar with basic object-oriented design concepts
- Know and understand basic coding, testing, and debugging strategies for large programs
- Learn the Java programming language
- Learn the fundamental concepts and implementation techniques of:
    - Relational databases
    - Graphical user interfaces
    - Mobile programming (specifically Android)
    - Web APIs
- Demonstrate the aptitude and work ethic necessary to succeed in computer science
